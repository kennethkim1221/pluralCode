    <!-- 
      '?' is the safe navigation operator. Since we us async in retrieving products,
      there could be a time where the service has not returned the products list yet but 
      our template will try to show the product object which will give us a runtime error
      like undefined. The SNO guards againts null/undefined values. It will simply return null and
      will not try to access the objects property.
      Limitations: It does not work in [(ngModel)] 2 way binding
      use the  to avoid this. 

    
      Another better way is to use *ngIf so that we wont need to use SNO for each property of the object
    -->  

<div class='card' *ngIf='product'>
  <div class='card-header'>
      {{pageTitle + ': ' + product?.productName}}
  </div>
  <div class='card-footer'>
      <button class='btn btn-outline-secondary'
              (click)='onBack()'
              style='width: 80px'>
      <i class='fa fa-chevron-left'></i> Back
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
